#Project Overview:

Objective: To develop a robust spam classifier using machine learning to distinguish between spam (1) and legitimate messages (0).
Data: Utilized a dataset with two main columns - 'v1' for classification labels ('spam' or 'ham') and 'v2' for the text content of emails.
Preprocessing: Cleaned and tokenized the text data, removing unnecessary characters and converting everything to lowercase.
Feature Engineering: Applied Count Vectorization to transform the text data into a format suitable for machine learning models.
Model: Employed a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier for its efficiency in text classification tasks.
Evaluation: Achieved an impressive accuracy of 98%.
